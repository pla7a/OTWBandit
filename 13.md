## Solution
The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on

```
bandit13@melinda:~$ ls
sshkey.private
bandit13@melinda:~$ ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost
Could not create directory '/home/bandit13/.ssh'.
The authenticity of host 'localhost (127.0.0.1)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is 05:3a:1c:25:35:0a:ed:2f:cd:87:1c:f6:fe:69:e4:f6.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
